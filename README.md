# Lackluster Video Prototype
Prototyping for Lackluster Video App Assignment UIS CS Capstone. Built with [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/).

----

## Build Setup

The Vue app can run entirely client-side (with a localhost) or can be run with webpack-dev-server (will create a host). Install NodeJS and NPM (Node Package Manager) to get started. Run npm install to install dependencies and check pacackage.json for defined scripts.

Some dependencies are used for the app build itself (Vue, Vue Router, etc..) and others are build tools (webpack, gulp). 

`$ webpack --watch && gulp watch`  will build the app when dependencies are saved

`$ npm start` will start the localhost dev server and run the app

`$ npm install` will install any missing dependencies, use if npm throws command or module not found errors

For more on running asset bundlers, task runners, etc... please see the docs for any such utilities.
