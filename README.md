##Build Setup

The Vue app can run entirely client-side (with a localhost) or can be run with webpack-dev-server (will create a host). Install NodeJS and NPM (Node Package Manager) to get started. Run npm install to install dependencies and check pacackage.json for defined scripts.

`$ npm run`  will build the app when dependencies are saved

`$ npm start` will start the localhost dev server

Scripts for any dependencies (such as gulp or webpack) can also be run from the command line. For example:

`$ gulp watch` will watch will run tasks such as compiling SASS files to CSS
